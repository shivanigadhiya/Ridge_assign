    "Magnitude of Coefficients: As in simple linear regression, the coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable (target). However, in Ridge Regression, the coefficients are penalized to prevent overfitting. Therefore, their magnitudes might be smaller compared to those in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinkage Effect: Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero but doesn't force them to become exactly zero (except in extreme cases). Larger values of the regularization parameter (lambda or alpha) result in more shrinkage. Therefore, the larger the value of lambda, the more the coefficients tend to shrink, and the closer they get to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative Importance: Even though the coefficients might be smaller due to regularization, their relative importance remains intact. The variables with larger (absolute) coefficients, regardless of their magnitude, have a relatively higher impact on predicting the target variable compared to those with smaller coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactions and Multicollinearity: Interpretation becomes more complex when considering interactions between variables or dealing with multicollinearity. Ridge Regression helps mitigate multicollinearity issues by reducing the impact of correlated predictors, but interpreting coefficients related to multicollinearity might be less straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Impact: If the variables are standardized (scaled), comparing the coefficients directly gives a sense of the variable's importance in the model within the scaled range. Larger coefficients (in absolute terms) generally signify a more substantial impact on the predicted outcome within the scaled range of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty Effect: Remember that the penalty in Ridge Regression is on the squared magnitude of coefficients (L2 regularization). Therefore, Ridge Regression does not perform variable selection by setting coefficients to exactly zero. Instead, it diminishes their impact continuously as lambda increases."
